      <h1>About DreamState</h1>
      <h3>I built DreamState as a way to log my dreams during a transitional period of my life. I noticed that my dreams represented a wide range of emotions and involved many different characters from my past and sometimes characters who I had never met before. I began to write them into my notebook but then decided that creating an application for me and others to log their dreams could be beneficial in deciphering this phenomenom.</h3>
      <h3>Dreaming is such a wonderful and mysterious part of life so I hope everyone can find comfort in reading their dreams from the past and finding commonalities.</h3>
      <h3>Eventually I will incorporate a social feed in DreamState so you can see what your friends are dreaming about too!</h3>
